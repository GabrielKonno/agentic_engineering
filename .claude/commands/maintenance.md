# Framework Maintenance Session

This is a framework maintenance session, not a project bootstrap.

**Authorized operations:**
- Edit files in `docs/` (framework documentation)
- Edit files in `examples/` (reference templates)
- Edit `CLAUDE.md` (framework contract)
- Edit `README.md`

**Rules still in effect:**
- Never modify files inside `projects/` (those belong to project repos)
- All changes must be committed with descriptive messages
- Verify cross-references after modifying any document

**Workflow:** Read the maintenance prompt/correction plan provided by the user, apply all changes in order, run verification, commit.

## Upstream intake — absorbing framework evolutions from projects

Projects record framework-level lessons in their own
`projects/<name>/.claude/docs/framework-evolution-*.md` (per the evolution-policy template's
"Framework-evolution docs — the upstream lifecycle" section). `projects/` is gitignored but
readable — those docs are legitimate INPUTS to a maintenance session (READING them never
violates the no-touch rule).

When the maintenance prompt asks for an upstream (or names such docs as sources), ALWAYS:
1. **READ each evolution doc fully**; anchor on its PORTABLE formulation section when present.
2. **Decide PER EVOLUTION:** graduate to `docs/modules/` / adapt (genericize) / reject — with
   a one-line reason each. "Evaluated and kept project-local" is a valid disposition.
3. **GENERICIZE on the way in** (project-information isolation is TOTAL): role descriptors
   only ("projeto-fonte", "a production project"), no project/client names, no source-project
   session numbers, no single-project vocabulary — templates get DOUBLE scrutiny (they
   broadcast to every future project). Proven artifacts (guard scripts, mutation-tested code)
   keep their code byte-identical; only provenance headers/comments are genericized.
4. **Record the batch in a lineage doc under `assets/docs/`** — what graduated, where each
   piece landed, what was adapted, and what was deliberately NOT absorbed (with why). That
   commit is the AUTHORITATIVE disposition for every doc in the batch.
5. **NEVER edit the project's own evolution docs** (no-touch rule) — marking them
   `upstreamed` is the project's own next session's job, guided by this repo's lineage record.
6. Run the post-change verification (cross-references, template fence extraction, D16
   isolation grep over every touched file) before committing.
